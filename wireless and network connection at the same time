On windows 7 you should configure the correspondent adapters.

Go to control panel --> network connections 
On the left tab select "edit adapter settings"

Select the wireless adapter, right click, properties

From the menu select "internet protocol version 4" then properties and then 'advanced'

On the bottom of the windows uncheck 'automatic metric'

Then insert a number starting from "2".
You will insert here a number that is lower than the number that you will insert with the same procedure in the wired connection. 
For example here you can insert "3"
Then apply everything.

Now do the same for the wired adapter (right click, properties,...)
In 'Automatic Metric' insert "4"

Then apply 

Now both wired and wireless connection should work properly.
