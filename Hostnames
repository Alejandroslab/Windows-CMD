when you set static IP remember that you can set it :

- from the router
you will go in IPV4 and change configuration adding a new static IP

- from the machine
Usually in the config settings there is the possibility to do that

anyways remember to do that possibly just from one source
so you will not forget your overall network config

this means  do all the static stuff from router or device by device
not mix it or you will forget it
