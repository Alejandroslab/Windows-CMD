When a shutdown occurs it could happen that Outlookl will break and you will not be able to
e.g. make replies to emails etc

the error is something like:

Outlook has been closed without properly closing your outlook data file (.ost)


to fix this:

if you don't use local calendars and have multiple email you can easily fix it
simply changin the account that 'holds' the .ost data file
to do that go to 'Account settings'-> 'Data File'-> choose another email account

outlook will warn you that local calendars will not be imported when using another email Account
just click ok

done!

now it work
