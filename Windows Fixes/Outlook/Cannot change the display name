the display name is the name that is displayed as sender

like

Mike Contoso

but sometimes you may see:

mike@contoso.com

instead of

Mike Contoso

as the seender of the email.

How to see 'Mike Contoso' instead of 'mike@contoso.com'
It is not possible.
it CANNOT be changed in any way in Outlook.
It can only be changed by the sender

This because the email will send also the name set by the sender as header.

so you CANNOT change it neither with messing with the contacts section

the sender should change in is accounts settings where is state 'Your name:'
It happens a lot of times that they do not change it.
Usually when a new account is created the default display name is the email address.

Therefore you will see it like mentioned.
