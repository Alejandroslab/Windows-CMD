GROUPS

You can also create groups (that essentially
are folders) within Outlook and they will be
mirrored in the iphone automatically
(if you still don't have groups
they will appear in your Contacts app in the top left corner)

Remember that if you create a new group, if you want to
see them in the address book you have to click right on
the group then 'Properties' then
click on the tab 'Outlook Address Book'
and finally check the option
'Show this folder as an email address book' choosing
a name that you desire (the same process as above)
