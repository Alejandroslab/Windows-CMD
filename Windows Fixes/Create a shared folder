In windows create a new folder, right click then go to 'Sharing'

Click on 'Share..'

In the textbox type 'Everyone'

Doing that everyone in your lan network will be able to access the folder.

to access to your folder you will need credentials.
REMEMBER! always take note of all your credentials even THE OLD ones
as windows sometimes will not recognize the new credentials if you change them!
such a crap...

REMEMBER! You internet connection should be set as 'Private Netwokr'!!

If it is set as 'Public Network' you will not be able to access to the shared folder!

go to wifi on the right side of the taskbar, select your connections, click on 'Properties' and you will be able to change
from 'Public network' to 'Private Netwokr'
