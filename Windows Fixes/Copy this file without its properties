Copying or moving a file without some of its properties from an NTFS drive to a FAT drive
will simply mean that the properties that can’t be transported will be lost,
but the file itself will remain intact and functional.
That being the case, it is completely safe for you to, when faced with this popup,
click on Yes and copy/move the file in question without some of its properties.

The reason why some properties of some files can’t be copied or moved from an NTFS
drive to a FAT drive is the fact that the NTFS file system is capable of storing some properties
(such as properties pertaining to ADS and file encryption information) that drives formatted with
the FAT file system simply can’t store.
