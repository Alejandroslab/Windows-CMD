If you have just one partion one windows proceed to shrink
the volume and create some unallocated space.

In order to do that open 'Disk Management'
click right on your volume
and select 'Shrink Volume'

wait for the system to load

Set how much space you want in the unallocated space
'Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB:'

then click on Shrink.
Rememebr this size as it could be useful when you will
install Debian.
Anyways at the end of the process your disk will be
shrinked and the unallocated space will appear
with a black label



now reboot your windows system!
and plug the Debian usb

select graphical install and proceed with the configuration

Set the hostname, the password for root
 a full name (can be also some initials), and username and a password to set an user


The most important thing during the installation is the
partition part
You can choose (to be faster and make your life easy)

'Guided - use the largest continuous free space'

it will automatically select the largest unallocated
space that you have previously created in Windows

Now select 'All files in one partition'

and check if everything is correct (see for Example
the free space (that is indicated with a letter f))

remember also that 2 partions will be created:

the main partition where the classic root folder '/' will be installed
and the swap partition a rather small partition to make
it everything work

you will also see your windows disks
you can recognize them because they are formatted
with ntfs

remember! primary will be windows partitions
while Debian will stay as logical

this configuration will perfectly work.

Now click on:

'Finish partitioning and write changes to disk'

confirm clicking yes

now if you have a general Debian usb image
then it will ask you for which desktop environment you wish
to be installed

otherwise it will proceed to install
your Debian version (let's say gnome or cinnamond or kde)

it will then ask you some infos but rather easy to configure
(like network (choose the wired one if you don't
know if your wireless adapter will work), keyboard layout, time)


finally
the other important thing is
to click YES on install GRUB boot loader to the master boot record

this will allow to choose with a menu for debian
or windows when booting up the system
