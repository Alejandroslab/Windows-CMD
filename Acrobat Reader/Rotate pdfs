In Acrobat Reader DC (the free version not the paid one)
is not possible to rotate a pdf easily (you have to get the paid version)

there is a workaround:
first go to view->rotate choose clockwise or counterclockwise as you need
(shorcut ctrl+shift+0 or ctrl+shift+1)

then go to file->Save as

and save your pdf with another name

close your current pdf

and reopoen the renamed and rotated version

done!
