Probably this is due to the fact that you have already set
some hosts in your hosts file that are assigned wrongly (due to e.g. a change in
the network ip ranges etc..)

therefore check your hosts file
if there is already any entry just change it as you need it
then save the hosts file open cmd and run:

ipconfig /flushdns

DONE! now hostnames should work
