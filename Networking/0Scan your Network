the easisest way to do this is using Angry Ip Scanner
(foss)

just download the portable version so you don't have to face problems installing

now you can scan your network

in Base IP
you can set different ip and also different masks
in 'IP Mask' (the default one is 255.255.255.0)

so this means that you can scan your network even if you are on
another mask

This is a common case when you set up a VPN
and you have different IP addresses (because of the different
mask)

therefore you can scan your netwrok even under a VPN
and check which devices are turned on and
which ports are opened.
