Open PowerShell
with ROBOCOPY you can sync two folders (in this case test1 and test2)
it comes already installed in widnows


ROBOCOPY "Test1" "Test2" /E /ZB /XJ /FFT /MT /R:2 /W:5 /V /MON:1 /TEE


/E      Copy subdirectories, including empty ones.
/ZB     Use restartable mode; if access denied use backup mode.
/XJ     Exclude junction points. (normally included by default).
/FFT    Assume FAT file times (2-second granularity).
/MT     Do multi-threaded copies with 8 threads.
/R:2    Number of retries on failed copies.
/W:5    Wait time between retries.
/V      Produce verbose output, showing skipped files.
/TEE    Output to console window, as well as the log file.
/MON:1  Monitor source; run again when more than 1 change seen.

/XF [files]  Exclude files matching given names/paths/wildcards.
/XD [dirs]   Exclude directories matching given names/paths.

with /W will wai time between retries..

if you don't want to wait but just want to do manual sync

in this way you will create a sort of backup that you can create setting as destination a shared network folder
this is basically a 'mirror' it will sync files perfectly, deleting files that are not present in the destination folder
ROBOCOPY "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder" "\\networkshare\networkfolder" /e /z /purge
/e will copy subdirectories even if empty while /purge will delete the destination files and directories when they don't
exist in the source

alternatively you can do

ROBOCOPY "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder" "\\networkshare\networkfolder" /mir /z

where /mir is equivalent to /e and /purge

remember! in this way will sync always from source to destionation
If we change destionation folder it will not be reflected in the source.

To accomplish the latter you can create a bat in order to sync in this 2-way

(remember that you can run multiple robocopy at once)
_________________________________

If you want to create a backup sync you can do it manually (first the first
way folder1 to folder2 and then folder2 to folder1)
or you can create a .bat file

Doing this robocopy will mantain the destination folder as a backup of the source one
Deleting files no more available in the source folder (thanks to /mir options)

open notepad and write

@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'
ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /mir /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'
ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /mir /z
echo Sync complete
pause

the good thing about robocopy is also that will copy files with the
date in which they were created without updating the
date to the actual date!


Now whenever you want to sync your folder you can run this script!

save notepad as 'my robosync.bat' (select all files in the save window)

then create a shortcut, put it wherever you want, click right and select 'Advanced' and 'Run as Administrator'

REMEMBER: Robocopy cannot do changes if you don't run it as Administrator!


Robocopy will work even with icloud drive and I think with all the cloud services. (I have tried that)
the important things is to specify correctly the paths.

REMEMEBER! it does not copy open files
DOne!
