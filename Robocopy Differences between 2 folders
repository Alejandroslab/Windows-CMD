With robocopy you can also check differences between 2 folder:

robocopy “\\FileShare\SourceFolder” “\\FileShare\ComparisonFolder” /e /l /ns /njs /njh /ndl /fp /log:reconcile.txt

Where
/e  Recurse through sub-directories (including empty ones)
/l  Don’t modify or copy files, log differences only
/fp  Include the full path of files in log (only necessary if you omit /ndl)
/ns  Don’t include file sizes in log
/ndl  Don’t include folders in log
/njs   Don’t include Job Summary
/njh   Don’t include Job Header
/log:reconcile.txt   Write log to reconcile.txt (Recreate if exists)
/log+: reconcile.txt   (Optional variant) Write log to reconcile.txt (Append if exists)

Warning Regarding the /NDL Option

The /NDL option is a handy way to suppress the inclusion of every folder checked (regardless of whether it contains differences) in the log,
but  because of the way it works it is not a good idea in all circumstances.
Consider the following before you use /NDL.

    Folders that exist only on source or destination are not logged unless at least one mismatched file is present or a source file is missing on destination.
    Folders that exist only on the destination are not logged at all regardless of contents.

Therefore if you want to check ALL differences just omit /ndl option:

robocopy “\\FileShare\SourceFolder” “\\FileShare\ComparisonFolder” /e /l /ns /njs /njh /fp /log:reconcile.txt


If you omit the /NDL option, it is necessary to include the /FP option if you want full paths listed for each file.
