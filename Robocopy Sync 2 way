@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'
ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /e /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z
echo Sync complete
pause

remember! do not put /mir or /purge in option otherwise data in the destination
folder will be deleted if not present in the source one

Anyways remember that doing this will not delete any folder

this means that
IF YOU WANT TO DELETE A FILE YOU HAVE TO DELETE IT TWICE:
once in the source folder and the other one in the destination folder




remmeber! options for robocopy are not case sensitive
meaning that /e is equal to /E
__________-

alternative with save of the log while printing in cmd at the same time:

@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'
ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /e /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'  /log:logfileout1.txt /tee

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z  /log:logfileout2.txt /tee
echo Sync complete
pause

the /tee option allows to save the log and display it at the same time
otherwise it will just save it in the log file.
