Title of robocopy scripts can have spaces in the name
RUN the scripts as Administrator

REMEMBER! In the case you have a Network shared folder:

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /mir /z

this command will not work if the network shared folder has some spaces in the name
to solve this you have to put a space at the end of the name like this:

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2 " "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1 " /mir /z

you see that 'myfolder 2' is now 'myfolder 2 ' with a space at the end!

Doing this will allow you to sync even for the network shared folders
