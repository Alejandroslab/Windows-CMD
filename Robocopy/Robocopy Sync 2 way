@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'
ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /e /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z
echo Sync complete
pause

remember! do not put /mir or /purge in option otherwise data in the destination
folder will be deleted if not present in the source one

Anyways remember that doing this will not delete any folder

this means that
IF YOU WANT TO DELETE A FILE YOU HAVE TO DELETE IT TWICE:
once in the source folder and the other one in the destination folder

REMEMBER!
if the destination folder does not exist
robocopy will create the folder!


remmeber! options for robocopy are not case sensitive
meaning that /e is equal to /E
__________-

alternative with save of the log while printing in cmd at the same time:

@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'
ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /e /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'  /log:logfileout1.txt /tee

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z  /log:logfileout2.txt /tee
echo Sync completed
pause

the /tee option allows to save the log and display it at the same time
otherwise it will just save it in the log file.


___________

if you need to exclude folders from sync just use the /xd option in this way:

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z
/xd "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\folder_to_exclude" "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\another folder" /log:logfileout2.txt /tee

echo Sync completed
