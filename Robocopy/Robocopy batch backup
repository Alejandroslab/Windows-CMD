in a bat file you can also specifiy multiple instances
of robocopy:

(and you can also add empty lines between commands
to keep it tidy)


the /e option is to copy all subdirectories the /z option is to restart the sync if something happens (restartable mode)

@echo off
echo Syncing Folders 'myfolder 1' to 'myfolder 2'

ROBOCOPY C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1"  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" /e /z
echo Now the other way around: 'myfolder 2' to 'myfolder 1'  /log:logfileout1.txt /tee

echo another syncing:

ROBOCOPY  "\\SERVER\home\networkfolder\myfolder 2" "C:\Users\myuser\myfolder 1" /e /z  /log:logfileout2.txt /tee

echo then you can add how many you wish:

robocopy "folder1path" "folder2path" /e /z
robocopy "folder1path" "folder2path" /e /z
robocopy "folder1path" "folder2path" /e /z
robocopy "folder1path" "folder2path" /e /z

echo and so on..


echo Sync completed!
