with robocopy you can overcome the
'path too long' problem in windows!

if you have some skipped files you can run robocopy
and it will copy all the directories and subdirectories
to your destionation folder without no issues

It will not replace anything with options /e and /z

robocopy “\\FileShare\SourceFolder” “\\FileShare\DestionationFolder” /e /z

It is safe as I have tested it with a folder with
path too long and files skipped while copying them with

ctrl+c and ctrl+v

REMEMBER! to exit from your sync folders BEFORE launching
robocopy otherwise it will not copy anything

DONE!
