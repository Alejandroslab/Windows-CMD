Launch as Administrator PowerShell

then just run this:

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client*

You will save a lot of time trying to enable ssh from menus...


after enabling ssh you will be able to connect to you servers within PowerShell but also
Ubuntu if you have installed it like a subsystem!


This means that you can connect even with 'platformio' terminal inside Atom (enabling Powershell)

Git Bash with ssh seems to not work properly (it freezes after right after the connection)
